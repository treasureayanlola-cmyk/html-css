            <details>
                <summary>What materials are your tote bags made from?</summary>
                <p>
                    The majority of our totes are made from **100% GOTS-certified organic cotton canvas** or a durable recycled polyester blend. We always specify the exact material on the individual product page for full transparency.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How much weight can your totes hold?</summary>
                <p>
                    Our standard canvas totes are rigorously tested and designed to safely carry up to **20 kg (44 lbs)** of weight. We use double-stitched seams and reinforced handles for maximum durability, perfect for groceries or library books!

            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Are your printing inks eco-friendly?</summary>
                <p>
                    Yes! We exclusively use **water-based, non-toxic, and vegan-friendly inks** for all our designs. This ensures both vibrant colors and a minimal environmental impact.

            <details>
                <summary>How should I wash my tote bag?</summary>
                <p>
                    For the best results and to preserve the print, we recommend **spot cleaning** first. If a full wash is necessary, machine wash on a **cold, gentle cycle** and air dry flat. Avoid using a machine dryer, as this can cause shrinkage and fading.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Did my cotton tote bag shrink?</summary>
                <p>
                    As with most natural fibers, some minor shrinkage (typically less than 5%) may occur if washed in warm or hot water. Always follow the cold wash instructions provided on the care label to minimize shrinkage.

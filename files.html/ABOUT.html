            <h2>The Teetee tote bags Difference</h2>
            <div class="features">
                <h3>**Quality & Craftsmanship**</h3>
                <p>
                    From the thread count of our organic cotton canvas to the reinforced stitching on our handles, 
                    we obsess over the details. Our totes are built to carry your heaviest groceries, your latest library haul, 
                    or your daily essentials for years to come.
                </p>

                <h3>**Sustainability Commitment**</h3>
                <p>
                    We prioritize ethical sourcing. Most of our bags are made from **100% GOTS-certified organic cotton** or recycled materials. We also use eco-friendly, non-toxic inks for all our unique designs.
                </p>

                <h3>**Art and Design**</h3>
                <p>
                    Our designs are inspired by some new release of tote bagsd. 
                    We collaborate with independent artists to ensure every tote is a piece of wearable art that starts a conversation.

            <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Treasure Ayanlola, and I started Teetee tote bags in 2019 out of a 
                simple frustration: I couldn't find a reusable bag that was both reliable and stylish. 
                What began as a small project in my apartment
                has grown into a community of passionate, eco-minded individuals. Thank you for supporting our dream!

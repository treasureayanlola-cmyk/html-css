            This image is based on animation[if you love anime you will love this image] it shows an image of an animated lady.It looks like the image of an adventurer,it also lookes like shes on a spaceship,i mean shes probably looking through the window of the ship[this is because looking at the background it is filled with a spacelike images it looks like the particles in space looking at background]

             This is also an amimated image too but its a whole lot different to the first image.The female in this image is looking rather lonely and also furious at the same time [furious in the sense that;the colour in her eyes representing anger].As we can also see shes sitting on a roof top and watching silently propably swearing and thinking at the same time.As we can see the uniqueness of her background.This images background is literally stylish and more unique than the first background.

            This is also an animated image it is a little bit related to the first image just that this image portrays a male character and the background is a little more like the first image but this one looks more and more of space but the character in this one is not a cheerful as the fisrt image. sometimes this space background is literally refering to how complicated how mind is that sometimes you dont feel like you are on earth anymore cause youve drifted to your mind space you become less concious of people around you for that particular moment.So i can say the character in this image is literally thinking about something and the background represents the way his mind is at that particular moment.
